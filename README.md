# dockSeparator
a do-nothing app that creates three dockable icons to be used as separators on macos

Does what it says on the can, to be honest.  
1. Build the three do-nothing apps in xcode.  
2. Go find where xcode put the .app bundles.  
    * (which is something like ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/dockSeparator-gobbledygook/Build/Products/Debug/...)  
3. Drag them to where you want them in the dock
